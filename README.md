# A-star for Non-holonomic Constraints
This project implements the A* algorithm to find the optimal path for a robot with non-holonomic constraints, specifically a differential drive robot with 8 action sets for movement.

# Part 1:
In Part 1, the A* algorithm is implemented in Python programming language with tkinter GUI for visualization. The visualization shows the exploration of nodes during the algorithm and the final optimal path from start to goal node on a 2D plane.

# Results
The project provides a clear visualization of the exploration of nodes during the A* algorithm and the final optimal path of the robot from start node to goal node. The tkinter GUI is used to plot the nodes and the path on a 2D plane.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Python installed on your system, along with the tkinter, math, heapq and numpy libraries. Clone the repository and run the main.py file to visualize the A* algorithm and the optimal path.

# Part 2:
In Part 2, the A* algorithm is implemented to find the optimal path for the Turtlebot3 burger, which is simulated in Gazebo world using ROS subscriber and publisher.

# Results
The simulation shows the Turtlebot3 burger moving from a user-defined start position to a goal position using the A* algorithm. The visualization is done in Gazebo world.

# Getting Started
To get started with the project, you will need to have Python, ROS Noetic, and Gazebo installed on your system. You will also need to install the tkinter, math, heapq, and numpy libraries for Python. Clone the repository and run the launch file to visualize the Turtlebot3 burger in Gazebo following the optimal path using the A* algorithm.
